## The Premise

Around 1971, nearly every chart about American prosperity broke. Wages flatlined. Inequality soared. Housing became unaffordable. Productivity gains no longer translated to worker pay.

**This project visualizes the data.**

## Key Charts

### Economics
- **Wage stagnation** - Productivity vs compensation (decoupled in 1971)
- **Income inequality** - Top 1% share skyrocketed
- **Housing costs** - Median home price vs median income
- **Dollar purchasing power** - 85% decline since 1971
- **National debt** - Exponential growth begins

### Social
- **Incarceration rate** - Prison population explosion
- **Labor force participation** - Women entered workforce (necessity, not choice)
- **Marriage rates** - Decline in marriage/family formation
- **Cost of living** - Healthcare, education, childcare unaffordable

### Book Integration: "A Generation of Sociopaths"

Bruce Cannon Gibney's thesis: The Baby Boomer generation's policies created these trends.

**Key arguments:**
1. **Gold standard abandonment** (1971) - Enabled endless money printing
2. **Tax cuts for wealthy** - Shifted burden to working class
3. **Deregulation** - Allowed corporate greed unchecked
4. **Student debt** - Made education unaffordable
5. **Environmental neglect** - Kicked costs to future generations

## Why This Matters

Understanding what happened in 1971 helps explain:
- Why millennials/Gen Z can't afford homes
- Why wages feel stagnant despite "economic growth"
- Why college is unaffordable
- Why retirement seems impossible
- Why political polarization increased

**The data doesn't lie. Something fundamental changed in 1971.**
